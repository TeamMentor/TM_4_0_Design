<p>Technical Support Service Levels. On receiving a request for technical support, Blatant gathers the support request information, categorizes the support request and creates a retrievable record of the request. All timelines for resolution are from the time that Blatant becomes aware of the error. Each party will notify the other promptly upon becoming aware of any error. Upon becoming aware of an error, Blatant will respond or escalate its support in accordance with the following levels of severity (“Severity Levels”): 275, 1011 9th Ave SE Calgary, AB T2G 0H7 Canada www.absorblms.com</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Level A: your operations that use the Service are significantly and adversely impacted because of the error. The Service is not available to Users, or functions or features are unavailable or the production system is down or significantly impaired and requires immediate attention. For example, course content does not load, or Users cannot log in.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Level B: the Service is functioning, but with impairment. For example, not all menus load, reports do not generate and browser specific issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Level C: your operations that use the Service are not significantly impacted by the error, but there continues to be a problem that is a nuisance. For example, graphics are missing, certificates do not print, or a small number of learners are affected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Level D: any error that is not a severity A, B, or C error is a severity D error. In the event you report an error with low severity that becomes more critical, you may contact Blatant’s technical support and request that the severity level for the error be upgraded. For example, spelling errors or errors not related to recording of learner data. Technical Support Action Times. </p>
