<p>SQL Injection is a common vulnerability that can have disasterous consequences if successfully attacked.  The vulnerability typically derives from defects in the database access code in an application.  The resources below provide information that will describe the vulnerability in detail and guidance in avoiding, remediating and testing it.</p>
<h3 id="getting-around">Getting around</h3>
<p> There are two ways to get around the Learning Path:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the sidebar navigation on the left-hand side of the screen to jump to the most relevant information for you; or</li>
<li>You can use the buttons at the end of every chapter to move to the previous or next chapter. </li>
</ul>
<p>The learning path will track where you&#39;re up to so that if you can&#39;t finish it in one sitting, it&#39;ll re-open at the last place you were at.</p>
