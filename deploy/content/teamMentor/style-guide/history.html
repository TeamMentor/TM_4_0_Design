<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Our roots are in application behavior and software quality, the underlying foundation for software application security.  We started as an application penetration testing company but realized that penetration testing alone was not enough to make our customers secure. </p>
<p>As a result, we evolved our services to include assessments at each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC): code review, threat modeling, architecture, design review, and the development lifecycle itself. These assessments highlighted the need for developer training and standards across the SDLC.</p>
