// HOW TO UNDERSTAND, USE AND EDIT THIS STYLESHEET

// TEAM Mentor was built mobile first , so the structure of this file means that styles without media queries apply to mobile and carry out throughout the whole application ONLY if there are no over-riding styles in the media queries.

// The structure for the file follows an hierarchal layout. Beginning from the top, everything is laid out in the order it appears. Styles are applied on the selector in alphabetical order.

//- Reset
//- Foundation
//- Global Variables
//- Typography
//- Jade Base
//- Flare Base
//- Flare Navigation
//- Media Queries
