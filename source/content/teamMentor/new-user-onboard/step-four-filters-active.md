### Results Filtered

There are a couple of options from here. You can read an article that interests you - click the title to see a summary and open it, save it for later or share it via email.

You can clear the search results (the button that says clear with the trash can) to start over again or you can save the search results for easy reference in the future. This is useful if you do a lot of work with specific technologies and regularly need to deal with vulnerabilities relating to that.
