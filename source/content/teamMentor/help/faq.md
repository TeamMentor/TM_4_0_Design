#### Q - My TeamMentor syncs to a whole bunch of repositories, I though only one repository is used?

A - You are mixing the Libraries sync with User_Data sync, In a TM server, each library can be synced to a github repo, but only to 1 User_Data repo (which is the one that has all the user data xml files and config stuff)
