##### TEAM Mentor was created by developers for developers using secure coding standards, code snippets and checklists built from 10+ years of targeted security assessments for Fortune 500 organizations.

It contains over 4,000 articles with dynamic content across multiple development platforms including .NET, Java, C/C++, PHP, Android and iOS. TEAM Mentor is the In-Practice companion to our [TEAM Professor eLearning courses](https://www.securityinnovation.com/training/application-security/computer-based/), extending developersâ€™ knowledge in combination with training.

TEAM Mentor integrates with static analysis tools, such as Checkmarx and Fortify&trade;, helping teams make more sense of scan results and make critical decisions to fix software vulnerabilities.
