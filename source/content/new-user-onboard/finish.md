# That's it, you're done.

Well, not entirely. There’s a lot more to TEAM Mentor than meets the eye but we think you know the most important parts so you can start learning and solving problems straight away.

If you’re interested in more in-depth tutorials, you can access them [here](help/index.html). Or alternatively, we have documentation which can be accessed at any time in the navigation bar, in the dropdown menu for the user.

If you have any feedback, please send us an email. Enjoy!
