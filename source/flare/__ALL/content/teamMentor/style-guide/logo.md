Our logo is at the heart of all communication aimed at our users.

#### Displaying our logo

* Only colour versions of the logo should be used;
* There should be no skew or distortion of the image;
* The size should be large enough that the logo is legible; and
* The quality of the image should be high enough that the image is not pixelated.

#### Written Style

In body text, TEAM Mentor should always appear in Helvetica (no bold, italics, outline or underline) with the word "team" in uppercase followed (with a space) by the word "mentor", only the initial letter of which is capitalised.
