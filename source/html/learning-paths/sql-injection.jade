				h3.dark-grey Getting around

				p There are two ways to get around the Learning Path:

				ul
					li You can use the sidebar navigation on the left-hand side of the screen to jump to the most relevant information for you; or
					li You can use the buttons at the end of every chapter to move to the previous or next chapter. 

				p The learning path will track where you're up to so that if you can't finish it in one sitting, it'll re-open at the last place you were at.
