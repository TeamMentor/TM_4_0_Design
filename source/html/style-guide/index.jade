							h5 How to use our colours
							br
							br

							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#white.short
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p White should only be used a background colour or font colour in places where there are colours or images as backgrounds (eg. Landing Page).
							br
							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									#green.short
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p The brand colour should be used for the company name and for action links (save, login, start your free trial etc.) as well as icons.
							br
							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#dark-green.short
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p The dark green should be used for anything that is active or on hover, but only when it starts in the TM green. This colour is very heavy, so it is never used as a headline or link colour.
							br
							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#grey.short
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p The light grey should be used as the lead colour for the opening headline on a page. An article title, filters headline, navigate options, user settings etc. The first thing that users read will be in this colour.
							br
							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#dark-grey.short
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p The dark grey is the main colour in the application. Body copy, article sub-headlines, related article headlines, options (filters), inputs and forms etc all use this colour.
							br
							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#black.short
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p Black is used very sparingly as it’s harsh on a straight white background. Only use it for real emphasis and always try to use the dark grey first.
