						h2 About Us

						#who-are-we
							h3 Who are we?
							p TEAM Mentor is one of several sub-companies inside Security Innovation, comprised of application security trailblazers - one of the first companies to focus solely on the critical aspect of Product & IT Security. 

							p Our team of professionals so good at what we do, we’re confident we can solve our clients hardest security problems. People so passionate about what we do, we get a rush knowing that we've made a direct impact on each and every client we work with.
							br
						// who-we-are-div

						#history
							h3 History
							p Our roots are in application behavior and software quality, the underlying foundation for software application security.  We started as an application penetration testing company but realized that penetration testing alone was not enough to make our customers secure. As a result, we evolved our services to include assessments at each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC): code review, threat modeling, architecture, design review, and the development lifecycle itself. These assessments highlighted the need for developer training and standards across the SDLC.

						// history-div

						#mission-statement

								li Relentless innovation;
								li Keep it simple;

								li Honest, open, caring, fun.

									br
									#white.short
								// column
								.col-offset-1.col-9

							br
							.row
								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#dark-green.short
								// column
								.col-offset-1.col-9
									p The dark green should be used for anything that is active or on hover, but only when it starts in the TM green. This colour is very heavy, so it is never used as a headline or link colour.

								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#grey.short
								// column
								.col-offset-1.col-9

								.col-offset-1.col-1
									br
									#black.short
								// column
								.col-offset-1.col-9

						#web
							h3 Web

							p The layout needs to be single column, using white space effectively to get the reader from the top of the page, to the bottom (where the call to action is).
							p As the user scrolls, they should be further persuaded to choose TM.
							p Visuals should highlight and support our main messages.
							p Screenshot of landing pages
						// web-div

						#advertising
							h3 Advertising
							p The communication must lead the reader with a motivating consumer benefit.
							p The benfit should focus on experiences that TEAM mentor can bring
							p Description headlines, phtoography of the businesses in action
						// advertising-div

						#pr
							h3 PR
							p Marketing is considered as core competence at TEAM Mentor and within the marketing mix public relations has always been used extensively by the team. Advertising can be very useful but it is relatively expensive. PR can be just as effective and it's free.
							p TEAM Mentor public relations is frequent and loud, open, quick to react, cheeky, fun and takes its job rather than itself seriously. Don’t ignore a journalist, there’s nothing wrong with admitting “I don't know, can I find out?”
